My Capstone Project Idea:

Predicting Credit Card Defaults: 
A Data-Driven Approach to Financial Risk Management

In today's competitive financial landscape, managing credit risk effectively is paramount. Credit 
card defaults can result in significant financial losses, disrupt revenue streams, and increase 
operational costs due to higher capital reserve requirements. Recognising these challenges, this 
project focuses on predicting credit card defaults through a comprehensive, data-driven 
approach.
I chose this research question because it directly addresses a critical business problem: 
minimising the financial impact of defaults while balancing the risk of denying credit to eligible 
customers. The data set I will be using provides a rich source of information, including demographic details, 
credit limits, billing amounts, and historical payment behaviour, making it an ideal candidate for 
predictive modelling. By applying a combination of advanced data cleaning, feature engineering, 
and machine learning techniques using Python, I aim to build a robust model that not only predicts
defaults accurately but also quantifies the cost implications of misclassifications. This integration 
of technical rigor with business-oriented evaluation ensures that the solution can drive strategic 
decisions and improve overall financial risk management. (Nirvana Ram)
